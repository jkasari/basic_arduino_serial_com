Hello, this is a basic terminal program I created to communicate with an Arduino through the serial port. I developed this project because I was having trouble finding a simple solution to easily send strings of characters to an Arduino using tools like minicom and screen.

My program opens a serial port at /dev/"user input serial port" with a baud rate of 115200. It receives input messages and sends them when the user presses the enter key.

I understand that there may be other programs that already provide this functionality. However, I found existing solutions to be overly complicated for such a simple task. As a result, I decided to create my own program to provide an easy-to-use solution for communicating with an Arduino through the serial port.
